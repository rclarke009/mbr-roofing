What is Google Maps Integration for Central Florida Service Areas?

Definition: Embedding a Google Maps iframe or static map on your site to display your service areas (e.g., Orlando, Seminole) and business location (if applicable). It helps clients visualize coverage and improves local SEO.
How to Implement:

Go to Google Maps, search “MBR Roofing Central Florida” or your address, click “Share” > “Embed a map,” and copy the iframe code (e.g., <iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=..."></iframe>).
Add to a new “Service Areas” page or homepage sidebar, styled with your blue highlights.


Why: Free, enhances trust, and targets local searches (e.g., “roofing near Orlando”). Static HTML supports this with manual code insertion.

Static HTML vs. Alternatives (Not WordPress)

Static HTML Pros:

Full control, no security update burden (your concern with WordPress).
Editable on your Mac with VS Code, deployable via FileZilla to GoDaddy.
Lightweight, fast for simple sites like yours.


Cons: No dynamic features (e.g., form submissions need external services like Formspree).
Alternatives:

Jekyll (Static Site Generator): Free, Mac-compatible, generates static HTML from templates. Requires learning basic Ruby (1-2 hours), but avoids WordPress security issues. Hosting on Netlify (free) possible.
Hugo: Another static generator, faster than Jekyll, Mac-friendly, free. Steeper learning curve but robust for SEO.


Recommendation: Stick with static HTML for now. It meets your needs (responsiveness with Bootstrap, content updates), and you’re comfortable with FileZilla uploads. Consider Jekyll later if dynamic content (e.g., blog) is needed, but it’s not urgent.
